## What is Daily Round Logger?

The project, initiated by NPS Information Systems Sàrl and supervised by M. Marina Ninoslav, aimed to develop
a specialized Android application using the Flutter framework to streamline measurement collection in
industrial settings. The core functionality centered on using QR codes to identify machines or specific points
within a facility, allowing users to scan these codes and enter corresponding measurements. This system was
designed to replace traditional manual entry methods, thus improving accuracy and efficiency in data collection
processes.

At its core, the application features an intuitive QR code scanning system, designed to rapidly and accurately
gather data from specific machinery or checkpoints within an industrial environment. This approach
significantly reduces the likelihood of manual entry errors and enhances the efficiency of the data collection
process.
